<h1>MedLearn Communities - GME The Shelter User Guide</h1>
<body>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Shelter is a project that has been proposed by many Mental Health Professionals with many decades of experience in helping medical residents to cope with the stress of current issues within the medical field as it relates to COVID-19. The purpose of the Shelter is to allow residents and fellows to connect with fellow colleagues with the intent of finding social support, validation, an ear to be heard, and a place where they can learn about techniques for coping and healing. <br /><br />The platform that this forum will live in is the communities’ section within MedLearn. MedLearn is the University of Arizona’s College of Medicine –Tucson online learning management platform that is used by medical students and others within the college. <br /><br />This user guide will assist users with logging into the Shelter community within MedLearn, view anouncements, and post/reply and view discussions.</p>

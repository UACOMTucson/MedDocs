## Import Assessment Scores
Grades can be imported from ExamSoft, NBME or from a “Generic” form.  This function can also be used where grades have already been uploaded/entered and should be replaced with higher grades.  

**Please NOTE:**  Grades from ExamSoft will not be posted by FTP as in the past. You will have to download them from ExamSoft and import them into MedLearn.

	* Press the **Choose a file** button
	* Indicate if you prefer to **Replace with higher grades** or **Replace all grades**

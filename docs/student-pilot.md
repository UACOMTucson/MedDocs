# MedLearn Student Pilot Guide
Thank you for participating in the MedLearn pilot.  We have created an icon on the MedPortal to help you access everything you need for the pilot.  Simply click on the icon “Fall 2017 Nervous System MedLearn Pilot”.  You will find icons to help you navigate to your profile, schedule, courses, assignments, ILMs, gradebook, surveys, absence request and important messages.  As well as a link to help you return to ArizonaMed.  The project team encourages you to submit course and system feedback through the portal (icon included).

### 1  Dashboard
The dashboard is displayed by default when logging in to MedLearn.  If you navigate away from the dashboard, simply click on the MedLearn logo or the **Dashboard** link to return to it.

**Please NOTE:**  Dashboard and Assessment & Evaluation functions in MedLearn will only show learning events and course-related functions that are specific to the pilot course.  Continue to use ArizonaMed for functions related to other courses.

## Request an Alternative Experience
Alternative experiences and sites vary dependent upon the selected rotation.  

* Click the **Clerkship** tab followed by **Alternative Experience**
* The **Alternative Experience Requests** screen is displayed
* Press the **New Request** button
* Select the **Course**, **Site**, **Alternative Experience**
* Add an **Explanation** for the request
* Press **Submit**
After submitting your request it will be forwarded to your clerkship coordinator. They can then either approve or deny the request.
    * **If Approved:** Log your alternative experience in the logbook with an explanation that you satisfied the requirement through a pre-approved alternative experience
    * **If Denied:** You will still need to complete the originally required logbook experiences, and cannot satisfy a requirement with the requested alternative experience

### Manage Absences
Students may be excused from mandatory classroom and clinical activities for cause (e.g. illness, conference presentations, leadership activities, personal passes, etc.).  Course directors and coordinators have the ability to excuse absences.  However, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs (and/or assigns) has the final say.

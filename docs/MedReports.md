**What is MedReports?**

MedReports is our educational reporting system. MedReports provides flexible reports for COM-T's various educational systems such as ArizonaMed, MedLearn, and OASIS. Access to each report is restricted to specific user groups. 

**What reports do students have access to?**

Currently, only Student Advisory Committee members have access to the Course Feedback report. This is the report that displays anonymous feedback provided by students in regards to their enrolled courses. Feedback is submitted through MedLearn, but the report is accessed through MedReports.

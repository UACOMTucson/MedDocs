Creating a Sign-up As a Program Orgainzer the first step is to set up a sign-up. A sign-up represents an individual event. This event represents an instance of the Shubitz Clinic however, it can represent any event that is scheduled for the CUP Clinic. To create a sign-up please follow these steps: From the dashboard in your account Click create new signup You will be presented with the details form for a new Signup Click the dropdown next to the Signup Kind feild Select Single or Multiple Days Click the Category dropdown and Select other Type a name for your signup (Note: you are only given 40 Characters for a name) Type a message in the Welcome Message field (Note: there is a charachter limit, it is as long as the sample message in the screenshot below) Type a location for the Location field In the other options area uncheck the following: Allow Participants to share their invitations with others Allow participants to swap spots Check the Affiliated with a school box Click the dropdown for the previous schools field and Select the University of Arizona Uncheck the box next to Email weekly status reports to your teacher Click the Organizer Information field Enter the Organizer Title Enter the Organizer Phone Click on What Information Do You Want From Participants arrow In the Additional Information box type: NetID (Note: This is a very important step, DO NOT SKIP IT . Participants will need to provide their NetIDs to have their hours count) Check the required box Click the arrow next to Limit Spots Per Participants Check the box in the Limit Spots section Determine how many spots a particular participant will be allowed to sign up for per Signup (Note: it should at least be one, Otherwise participants can sign up for multiple positions per sign-up.) Click Next You will now be asked to create spots 2.1 Create Spots for a Sign-up Each signup needs spots to be created. These spots can be thought of as the positions that a student will sign up for. Each Sign-up should have one or more spots to be utilized for the event. Creating the spots can be done while the Sign-up is created. To create spots follow these steps: After creating the Sign-up you will be navigated to a screen with a calendar From this calendar you can pick on the day to start creating spots but it is easier to just click on the Create New Spots button In the Add a Spot from the first section labled What do you want people to sign up for Enter the number of spots you would like to create for ONE spot (Ex. Caregiver will have 4 spots for the Sign-up Shubitz Clinic) Enter the time for the spot: Important: Make sure you enter the total amount of time for this spot as the participant's hours will be a total of these hours (Ex. 5:30PM - 10:30PM = 5Hrs). If the spot includes travel time that the participant will get hours for, make sure you account for that time in these time slots If the participant will not be credited for travel time do not add the travel time into this total Rule of Thumb: The time counts the hours automatically that the participant will get credit for At this point, if you have another spot to add, you can add another spot by Clicking on Add Another. However, it is better to add additional spots from the calendar on the previous page If you would like to set this spot as a recurring spot leave the radio button on. Select individual days using the calendar checked in the second section Choose the dates to add this spot to individual days If you would like to set this spot as a recurring event click the Set up as a repeating schedule button in the second section Set up your recurring schedule Add any details about the spot in this third section Click Save If you have other spots that need to be set up follow steps 2 - 12 in this section When you have set up all of your spots each day should look like the screenshot below with a list of spots for your signup You have complete setting up spots for your signup. 2.2 Choosing a Theme This spot is used if you would like to add a these to your signup. By default nothing needs to be done on this page. Just click skip. 2.3 Invite People to your signup As a CUP Clinic Signup there wiould be no need to \"Invite\" participants as the calendar will be accessed from MedCats with all signups listed in a group page. If you would like to invite specific people or post the signup to Social Media you will be able to create a link to do that. However, this will not be completed from the page below. This ability will be discussed later in another section of this guide. Click done to finish creating your signup. 3. Managing your Sign-ups After creating your signup there are a few configurations that you must complete before the Signup is ready to be listed for participants to see and signup for spots. Most of these items are required but some are not. The opttional configurations will be noted. 3.1 Email Preferences (Mandatory) As an organizer you are able to set email preferences such as the ability to send automatic messages to participants who signed up for a spot a couple days prior to the event to remind them of their sign-up. You can also notify participants when spots have changes, to adding extra details to reminders. To edit/set your email preferences please follow these steps: From the Dashboard Find your Sign-up (Ex. 2020-02 Shubitz Clinic) Click on the name of your Signup to open the event Click the settings tab Select Email Preferences On this page you will be able to modify email settings Set the email settings to your needs Note: You need to set the selection to ALWAYS for the Notify Me when Someone signs up Click Save at the bottom of the form to save your changes 3.2 Premium Locking (Mandatory) As an organizer you have the ability to lock down your Sign-up. You can tell theprogram when you want the Sign-up to open and allow participants to sign up for spots. You can also decide when the Sign-up will close and send email reminders notifying participants of when these dates will take place a few days prior to the dates taking effect. For the CUP Clinic Spots you must set the Sign-up to Lock 1 week prior to the activity date. The reminder must be set to send 2 days prior to the event locking date. (Ex: Signup takes place on March 10th 2020, Set locking date to March 3rd 2020, Send reminder on March 1st 2020.)

If not you will need to contact Hildi Williams to fix the issue. 3.5 Commenting Changes for Special Circumstances (Mandatory - Only if special circumstances need to be considered) Each registrant for a signup has the ability to comment in any issues that may arise from a particular event.

The oprion is perfect for enforcing locking rules for recurring spots that occure once a month. To duplicate a signup: Click the Dashboard Locate the signup that you want to duplicate in the My Signups area Click the Tools menu Select Duplicate Type a New Name for your signup Click Move Spots to New Start Date Select the date you want the spots to start Click Duplicate Click the spot to double check all information is copied over Enable the Locking Features in Section 3.4 Publish the new posting to the Medcats Group page as in Section 3.5 Click details Affiliate the spot with the University of Arizona Uncheck the Email weekly status reports to your teacher Ensure the Assistant Organizers are assigned, If needed Ensure the NetID is added as an additonal field Ensure Limit Spots to 1 spot per signup is enabled Click update 3.7 Assistant Organizers (Optional) Assistant Organizers are individuals that you can assign privilages to so they will be able to manage and edit a signup that you created. Signup.com allows each signup the ability to have up to 15 Assistant Organizers. This section will explain the process on how to assign Assistant Organizers. A seperate user guide will be created for Assistant Organizers.

For example, you can edit a participant for a spot such as delete them or assign an individual to a spot. To Delete an individual from a spot: Click Spot in the Menu Click List view next to Spots to view each spot for a signup Click Assign next to the individual spot Click the X to delete the individual participant Click Delete Only This Assignment or Delete all Future Assignments (This depends on you) to delete the participant To add an individual to a spot: Click Spot in the Menu Click List view next to Spots to view each spot for a signup Click Assign next to the individual spot Enter the User\u2019s email address and select their account from the dropdown (Ex.

To Send messages to all participants: Click the Messages item in the menu Click Select Email Participants You have the option to send to individual participants or by a specific group Click the tick marks next to the Participants Name Filter by Status, Date Scheduled or Spot Select the results in the please select one field If you want to send to all participants Click Add All Click Save List Enter a subject in the subject line or leave it the same Enter you message in the message field Click Send to send 3.12 Reporting (Optional) Signup.com allows Organizers to gather reports. Assistant Organizers can access these reports from a Signup Level only. To Generate reports for a Signup: Click Reports in the Menu Select a report to generate. 3.13 Adding Participants to an event if the event has already passed Adding participants after an event is not a very good practice as all participants should have signed up for the event and the record will be created in Signup.com so hours can be given to the person who participated. However, we realize mistakes happen and as such Organizers can add participants to an event after it has taken place. There is a limited timelimit to complete these steps. Reports are pulled at the beginning of the month for the month prior. Example: Events for May are pulled in June. If a participant is added at the beginning of the month after an event happened the person will still not get credit as the report for that month has already been pulled. However, if the person is not registered for an event and that registration is added during the same month they will be counted as the report will pull the added person. If you miss this time window you will have to contact Hildi Williams to correct the issue. Easy way to handle this is to not let it happen in the first place! To add a person to an event that has already happened please follow these steps: Log Into Signup.com Click on your dashboard tab Click on the event that you need to add the person to Click the Spots tab Click the List View for the spots Find the event date in the list and expand it. Click assign Click the Assign this spot field Select Add new Participant The form will populate Enter the Name Enter the Email Enter the NetID - This is important Enter the netID, if you don\u2019t know it you can get it from the email address as the email is netid@email.arizona.edu Click done They will be added to the event Click Comment in the event Enter a comment Click Add The process is complete","title":"Cup Organizer"},{"location":"cup_student/","text":"Signup.com Student Guide 1.
